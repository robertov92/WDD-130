        </table>
        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: 'Playfair Display', serif</h4>
        <p>An elegant font that resembles the culture of the Church. Making it cursive makes it look even more elegant.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: 'Raleway', sans-serif</h4>
        <p>This is not as elegant as 'Playfair Display', but it reminds me of the font used for the scriptures. Besides, this font is easier to read, which is helpful for paragraphs.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe alternative for your family.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service.
            Let us take care of you.</p>
