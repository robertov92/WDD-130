        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to become a meeting point for experienced programmers who are buiding their portfolio, and new programmer who want to receive counsel on how to improve their programming skills.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My target audiences are college students and self-taught programming students who need guidance. Ideally, my visitors would want to find answers on how to improve their programming/coding skills. They would be people who feel lost and do not know
            what path to choose. The website would be also for a more experienced programmer who would like to share their knowledge with students by writing blogs or answering questions. This can be an opportunity for the more experienced to do some
            networking and build their portfolio.</p>
