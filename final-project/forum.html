            <h2>Why using this website instead of others more popular sites?</h2>
            <div class="date">December 11, 2020</div>
            <p class="paragraph">That is a great question! There are big companies for pretty much everything, for example, restaurants. There are hundreds if not thousands of McDonals out there to satisfy our hunger, though that is not enough reason to get lunch at a local
                restaurant.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Many times small places want to give better service because they want to attract people and grow. That's what we are doing! We want to be more helpful than the other websites, so we can gain your trust and keep growing.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Besides getting questions answered, we would like to give a more personalized mentoring experience, and all this for free! Now you know, check us out and see if you like the local restaurant better than McDonald's.</p>
